# About

**shell-config** is really just my personal shell configurations. So, yeah.

## Usage

Download and install [Sauce Code Pro Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads) first.

### Bash

Please install first using a non-root user.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rfpludwick/shell-config
shell-config/bash/install/main.sh
```

Installing without `git` on the system?

```bash
bash <(wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfpludwick/bash-config/main/bash/install/no-git.sh)
```

If you want to setup the root user too, then run `bash/install/main.sh` as root.
